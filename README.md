=================

a tic tac toe game written in ruby

Just a recent Java programmer trying to figure out ruby again.

I was running this with ruby1.9, but it may be backward compatible.
I haven't tested.

## TODO
- Realized in trying to get MinmaxPlayer to play as O that the catalog is broken
  - currently evaluates backwards for O move in game explorer (I think)
  - well looked at this a bit, but didn't see the problem, yet
- implement hash for move values in catalog to save space
